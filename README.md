# Preturk

Preturk package is built to simplify the data selection which required we need to get manually labelled.

It uses NLP(Transfer Learning) and ML(Clustering) techniques to select best samples based data variation and patterns.

# Why data selection for labelling is important?

With popularity of Transformer and complex deep learning Techniques we have achieved better results. But they bad at dealing inherent bias.
So we need to have datasets which are having bias as low as possible.

Stopping Bias propagation at data creation and labelling could be the very first step towrads better generalization.
